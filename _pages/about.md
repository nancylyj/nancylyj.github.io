I am a PhD student in [DigiHealth Lab](https://digihealth.ucsd.edu/) at University of California, San Diego, advised by Prof. [Edward Wang](https://www.ejaywang.com/). I am also affiliated with [The Design Lab](https://designlab.ucsd.edu/).

Prior to UC San Diego, I earned my MS from University of Washington Seattle, where I was advised by Prof. [Shwetak Patel](https://people.ece.uw.edu/patel_shwetak/). I was also fortunate to work with Prof. [Vikram Iyer](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~vsiyer/). My work at [UW Ubicomp Lab](https://ubicomplab.cs.washington.edu/) focuses on wearable devices and multimodal physiological sensing.

My research interests lie in developing intelligent end-to-end systems that serve as ubiquitous assistants to human beings, with an emphasis in healthcare domain.
